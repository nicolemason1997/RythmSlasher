# RythmSlasher
Rational

Game:
The game is similar to the Rhythm Slasher game. I created the game in unity and made all the assets in 3ds max. To play the game you enter the menu screen where you have Instruction, play and exit. You then hit the objects coming towards you with the correct colour sword to gain points if you are not successful in hitting the correct colours you will not gain points. At the end of the game a black object will come towards you to end the game.

Video:
The video is showing the paper prototype process. Then shows my research of the game by basically playing other games. It then shows me actually playing the game.
